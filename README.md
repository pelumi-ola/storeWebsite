## Custom CSS (`style.css`)

A custom `style.css` file enhances branding and design with:

- Gradient text headings
- Hero and promotional banners
- Product card hover animations
- Category icons and newsletter styles
- Footer design and link effects

## Design Choices

During development, I focused on:

Clarity: Minimalistic design with plenty of whitespace for better readability.

Consistency: Using Bootstrap’s grid system for uniform layouts.

Color Psychology: Soft blues and purples for trust and modern appeal.

Accessibility: Readable fonts and balanced color contrasts.

Each section of the site maintains a consistent tone and layout to ensure users can navigate effortlessly, whether they’re on mobile or desktop.

## What I Learned

Structuring a multi-page website using semantic HTML5.

Designing responsive layouts with Bootstrap’s grid and flex utilities.

Applying custom CSS for hover effects and visual appeal.

Maintaining consistent branding across multiple pages.

Organizing and documenting projects professionally for presentation.

## Responsiveness

The website was tested on different devices to ensure proper layout scaling across:

- Desktop screens

- Laptops and tablets

- Mobile phones
